![Astro Sphere Lighthouse Score](_adrian.jpg)

Astro Sphere is a static, minimalist, lightweight, lightning fast portfolio and blog theme based on my personal website.

It is primarily Astro, Tailwind and Typescript, with a very small amount of SolidJS for stateful components.

## 📄 Configuration

The blog posts on the demo serve as the documentation and configuration.

### Analytics (Umami)

1. Create a free account at [umami.is](https://umami.is), add this site, and copy its website ID.
2. Local dev: copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `PUBLIC_UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID`.
3. Production (GitHub Pages): add a repository variable named `PUBLIC_UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID` under *Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables*.

The script only loads on production builds, never in `astro dev`.

### Comments (giscus)

1. Enable "Discussions" under the repo's Settings tab.
2. Go to [giscus.app](https://giscus.app), select this repo, and copy the generated `repo-id` and `category-id`.
3. Fill in `GISCUS.REPO_ID` and `GISCUS.CATEGORY_ID` in `src/consts.ts`. Comments stay hidden until both are set.

## 💻 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

Replace npm with your package manager of choice. `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, `bun`, etc
