After a few wonderful weeks ðŸ’’ , I'm happy to present the official website of my wedding https://adrianyana.com/en. I'm incredibly grateful for his effort, dedication and patience throughout this project. It was quite a challenge, as we both learned a new technology, Next.js, from scratch, which brought a lot of obstacles along the way. But, step by step, we overcame each one of them. We will keep improving the site and adding new features, we hope you like it!
