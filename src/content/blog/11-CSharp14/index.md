title: "What’s New in C# 14: More Power, Less Code"
summary: "The .NET ecosystem keeps evolving, and with the release of C# 14 alongside .NET 10, developers now have a fresh set of features that make the language even more expressive, concise, and powerful. In this post, I’ll walk you through the key improvements in this new version, with clear and practical examples."

## 1. Extension Members: Beyond Extension Methods

C# 14 takes extension methods to the next level. You can now define properties, indexers and more within `extension` blocks, giving you more power to enhance existing types:

```csharp
public static class EnumerableExtensions
{
    extension<T>(IEnumerable<T> source)
    {
        public bool IsEmpty => !source.Any();
        public T this[int index] => source.Skip(index).First();
    }
}
```

This is great for encapsulating reusable logic without touching the original type.

---

## 2. Improved Null-Conditional Assignment

The `??=` operator gets an upgrade – it now works with more complex null-conditional expressions:

```csharp
myObject?.Property ??= defaultValue;
```

A clean and elegant way to assign values only when something is null, without needing if statements.

---

## 3. `nameof` Supports Open Generic Types

You can now get the name of an open generic type using `nameof`:

```csharp
nameof(List<>); // Returns "List"
```

Very handy for logging, code generation, or validation scenarios.

---

## 4. Better Support for `Span<T>` and `ReadOnlySpan<T>`

C# 14 expands implicit conversions between `Span<T>`, `ReadOnlySpan<T>`, and arrays (`T[]`), making high-performance memory operations safer and easier to work with.

---

## 5. Lambdas with Modifiers

Lambdas can now use modifiers like `ref`, `out`, `in` or `scoped` without needing explicit parameter types:

```csharp
TryParse<int> parse = (text, out result) => int.TryParse(text, out result);
```

This is especially useful with APIs that involve references or output parameters.

---

## 6. Accessing Auto-Property Backing Fields with `field`

A subtle but useful feature: you can now access the backing field of an auto-implemented property directly:

```csharp
public string Message
{
    get;
    set => field = value ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(value));
}
```

This allows you to add validation without having to declare a private field manually.

---

## 7. Partial Constructors and Events

The concept of partial members is expanding — you can now declare **partial constructors** and **partial events**. This is particularly useful in code generation scenarios or when working with partially generated classes.
