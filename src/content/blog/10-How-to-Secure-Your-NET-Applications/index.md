title: "How to Secure Your .NET Applications"
summary: "Security is one of the most critical aspects of modern application development. In an era where data breaches and cyber threats are increasingly common, securing your .NET applications is not optional – it’s essential. This guide covers practical strategies and tools you can apply right now to make your applications safer and more resilient."

![How to Secure Your .NET Applications](secure.png)

## 1. Implement Strong Authentication and Authorisation

Security begins with ensuring only the right people access your application. .NET offers robust options for managing identity and access control.

- **Use ASP.NET Core Identity** for user and role management.
- **Integrate external providers** like Microsoft, Google, GitHub via OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect.
- Prefer **policy-based authorisation** over simple role checks for more granular control.

```csharp
services.AddAuthentication("Cookies")
    .AddCookie("Cookies", options => {
        options.LoginPath = "/Account/Login";
    });
```

```csharp
[Authorize(Policy = "AdminOnly")]
public IActionResult AdminDashboard() => View();
```

## 2. Protect Sensitive Data

Your app likely handles personal or confidential data. It's crucial to protect it both during transmission and while stored.

- Use **HTTPS** to encrypt data in transit (see section 4).
- Store passwords using **ASP.NET Identity’s built-in hashing**.
- Use the **Data Protection API** for encrypting custom data like tokens.

```csharp
var protector = _dataProtectionProvider.CreateProtector("MyApp.Purpose");
var protectedData = protector.Protect("my-secret-data");
var unprotected = protector.Unprotect(protectedData);
```

## 3. Prevent Common Attacks

Many attacks can be mitigated by using .NET’s security features correctly.

- **SQL Injection**: Use **Entity Framework Core** with LINQ or parameterised queries.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Razor views automatically encode content. Avoid `@Html.Raw()` unless necessary.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Enabled by default with `[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]`.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement CSP headers to mitigate advanced XSS attacks.

```csharp
var user = await _context.Users
    .Where(u => u.Email == email)
    .FirstOrDefaultAsync();
```

## 4. Enforce HTTPS and Secure Headers

Ensuring encrypted communication and proper HTTP headers is vital for protecting user data.

```csharp
app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.UseHsts(); // Adds HTTP Strict Transport Security
```

### Production Example (appsettings.json + Startup)

```json
"Kestrel": {
  "Endpoints": {
    "Https": {
      "Url": "https://*:5001",
      "Certificate": {
        "Path": "certs/yourcert.pfx",
        "Password": "yourpassword"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Add secure headers using middleware like [NWebsec](https://github.com/NWebsec/NWebsec).

## 5. Manage Secrets Securely

Avoid hardcoding secrets like connection strings or API keys in your codebase.

- Use **.NET Secret Manager** for local development.
- Use **Environment Variables** in staging or production.
- Use **Azure Key Vault** for secure, scalable secret management.

```csharp
var secret = configuration["MySecret"];
```

### Example with Azure Key Vault

```csharp
builder.Configuration.AddAzureKeyVault(
    new Uri("https://<your-vault>.vault.azure.net/"),
    new DefaultAzureCredential());
```

## 6. Keep Dependencies Up to Date

Outdated packages are a common entry point for attackers. Stay current using automated tools:

- `dotnet list package --vulnerable`
- GitHub Dependabot
- [OWASP Dependency-Check](https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-check/)

## 7. Add Logging and Monitoring

Proactive logging helps you detect and respond to suspicious activity.

- Log failed logins, access denials, and other events.
- Use **Serilog**, **NLog**, or built-in logging with `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging`.

```csharp
Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
    .WriteTo.Console()
    .CreateLogger();
```

### Cloud-based monitoring options

- **Azure Application Insights**
- **Sentry**, **Datadog**, **Seq**

## ✅ Security Checklist

Before deploying your .NET app, review the following:

- [ ] HTTPS is enforced
- [ ] Secrets are not in source control
- [ ] Authentication & Authorisation are in place
- [ ] CSRF and XSS protections are active
- [ ] SQL access is parameterised or via EF Core
- [ ] Secure headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.) are configured
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Monitoring/logging is active

## Final Thoughts

Security is a journey, not a destination. By following these best practices, you’ll significantly reduce risk and build trust with your users. As threats evolve, so should your defences. Keep your knowledge up to date, review your code regularly, and never stop improving.
